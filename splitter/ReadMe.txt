Thanks for downloading FileSplitter 1.0 !

Very often we come across the problem that a file is too large
to be transferred through a floppy disk,which is the most efficient
portable file carrier. Although there are many zipper programs which
can compress a file to an extent,we find that the file is still 
larger than a floppy disk size. My FileSplitter can split a file
(obviously larger than 1.38 mb) into a number of *.spt files which
can be transferred through a floppy. After carrying the split files,
with the help of the program one can fuse the split files to get the
original file. In my program I have kept the option that if the file 
cannot be fitted in maximum of 9 floppy disks, then the program gives 
a message that "the file is too large to split". I have kept this 
condition since it is not very useful to split a large file if it
takes more than 9 floppy disks to carry. 

While every possible care is taken, to ensure that the software is 
efficient and bug free. However any kind of suggestions are invited 
from the users to make the software more efficient and full-proof.
